<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many CRMs for automating recruitment, but I didn't find one that really fits my needs, so I'm building my own application based on my experience both in-house and in a recruitment agency.

Here's why:
Everyone needs harmony between work and personal life. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to automate routine processes as much as possible.
Recruiters should use a recruiting app to avoid:
* wasting time manually sending out messages,
* filling out dozens of tables on third-party services to report,
* accounting of vacancies and customers on third-party services, 
* accounting of candidates and their promotion through the funnel on third-party services.

Of course, this application may not be suitable for some companies, as the selection processes may differ, so I will be glad to receive recommendations from you to expand or refine the functionality.
